# Spottearly

Spottearly is a Python-based toolkit designed to analyze time-lapse imagery and detect the earliest signs of plant germination and growth. Whether you’re a researcher monitoring seed trials or a hobbyist documenting your garden’s progress, Spottearly automates the process of spotting initial growth, generating visual reports, and flagging anomalies.

## Features

- **Automated Germination Detection**: Analyze image sequences to determine the precise moment seeds begin to sprout.  
- **Customizable Thresholds**: Fine-tune detection sensitivity and regions of interest via a simple YAML configuration.  
- **Visual Reports**: Generate annotated images and time-lapse videos highlighting early growth stages.  
- **Flexible Input Formats**: Support for JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and common camera RAW formats.  
- **Batch Processing**: Process folders of image sets in parallel for high-throughput analyses.  

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/early-plant-scripts.git
   cd early-plant-scripts
````

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration

Spottearly uses a YAML file (`config.yaml`) to specify detection parameters:

```yaml
input_dir: "./images"
output_dir: "./results"
threshold: 0.05      # Pixel-change threshold for germination
roi:
  x: 100
  y: 50
  width: 400
  height: 300
```

Adjust `threshold` and `roi` values to match your imaging setup.

## Usage

Basic command-line usage:

```bash
python spot_early.py --config config.yaml
```

Additional options:

* `--preview` : Show real-time annotations as images are processed.
* `--video`   : Output a compiled time-lapse video (.mp4) of the annotated growth.

Example:

```bash
python spot_early.py --config config.yaml --preview --video
```
